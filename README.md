This paper is for the subject models in Operation Research. This paper contains of the study of the Simulated Annealing algorithm. Our study is determining the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
In this project, the simulated annealing algorithm is developed for 0/1 knapsack problem. 
This report divided into three part which are determining the parameters of the algorithm, identify the initial solution approach to find better results and how to propose/toss a move respectively. 
All parts are done with four problem instances with di↵erent number of items and knapsack capacities.
These are with 24 items and 6404180 knapsack capacity, 100 items and 995, 997 knapsack capacity, 200 items and 1008 knapsack capacity respectively.
The programming language that we have used in the implementation of algorithm is Java Programming language. 
The reason that we have chosen two di↵erent approach for finding the initial solution is the user would be more flexible.
